"A program that reads movement instructions (U, D, L, R) from an input file and translates them into a numeric passcode based on numpad navigation. Each line in the file represents a series of directional commands that move a cursor around a virtual 3x3 numpad grid. Empty lines are interpreted as stationary, and the program outputs a passcode corresponding to the final positions after all movements have been processed."

This description captures the key elements: reading from a file, interpreting movements, and producing a numeric passcode. You could also mention that the initial position starts at the center of the numpad (position 5) for additional clarity.
